                Courses are categorized as Core Theory (CT), Core Practice (CP) and Electives (EL).
            </li>
            <li>
                Each course has a course number. Course number includes the offering department or knowledge segment code and a three digit number. Knowledge segment code is used when a course is offered by any one or more departments with the same course content and syllabus. Details on this are given under Rule, RU-1.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li><h6> Faculty Advisor/Counsellor</h6></li>
        <p>All students shall have faculty advisors whose role will be:- To guide and help students on academics To monitor their progress in academics and advise them To counsel them and hand-hold them in any difficulty </li>
        </p>
        <li><h6>Course Registration and Enrolment</h6> </li>
        <p>It is mandatory for students to register for the courses they want to attend in a semester. Students admitted freshly to the first semester, are advised to register for all courses listed for the semester. However they do not have to enrol for the semester. All other students are required to register at the end of the semester for the courses they desire to take in the coming semester. They have to enrol for these courses at the beginning of the new semester, based on the previous semester results.  This allows them to make changes in the list of courses already registered for. Before enrolment, students should clear all dues including any fees to be paid and should not have any disciplinary issues pending. The dates for registration and enrolment will be given in the academic calendar. Any late registration or enrolment, allowed up to 7 working days from the stipulated date, will attract a late fee. A student can withdraw from a course or substitute one already registered by another on valid reasons with the approval of the faculty advisor. However this has to be done within seven working days from the commencement of the semester. The maximum number of credits a student can register in a semester is limited to 26. </p>
<li><h6>Course Completion and Earning of Credits</h6></li>
        <p>
            Students registered and later enrolled for a course have to attend the course regularly and meet the attendance rules of the university [RU-2] and appear for all the internal evaluation procedures for the completion of the course. Credits for the course are earned only on getting a pass grade in the composite evaluation. </p>
        <li><h6>Core courses, Prerequisites and Electives</h6></li>
        <p>
            All courses listed in the curriculum, other than the electives, are core courses.   Earning credits in the core courses is mandatory for the B. Tech. degree. For electives, failure to earn credits does not necessarily require repeating the course. Instead another approved elective is permitted as a replacement course by the faculty advisor concerned. For some courses there could be a prerequisite course completion requirement for registration.
        </p>
        <li>
            <h6>Summer Courses </h6>
        </li>
        <p>Students who could not earn the required minimum credits at the end of the second or fourth semester have two options to continue with the studies. They may register again for the courses, when they are offered in the next academic year. However, there is also a provision to run summer courses in failed courses for these students who may register and attend the course and write the final examination. This provision is only for students who have got 45% or more in the internal evaluation for the courses they attended in the regular semester.  Students should have 75% attendance in the summer course to write the examination. For the final grading their internal evaluation marks obtained in the regular semester in which they had undergone the course shall be applicable.  Summer courses are to be conducted for a minimum of 20 contact hours for each course. Summer courses are to be offered only at the end of the second and fourth semesters for the courses covered till that semester. They will be conducted either by all colleges or only by some, depending on the number of students registering for them. Details of summer courses planned will be announced by the colleges after the declaration of the even semester results. Final examination for summer courses will be conducted by the University. Based on the availability of faculty and the number of students opting for courses, it will be the prerogative of the colleges to decide on the summer courses to be offered</p>
        <p><u>Options for the fifth and higher semesters</u></p>
        <p>For higher semesters, i.e., fifth semester onwards, summer courses are not offered.  Failed students who have less than 45% marks in internal assessments have to register again for the course in the regular semester in which it is offered and complete the course as per the regulations and appear for the end semester examination. Failed students having 45% marks or more in internal assessments have the option to register again for the course as mentioned above or register only for the end semester examination without attending the course again. A separate registration format will be available for this. This option is available in all semesters.   </p>
        <li><h6>Contact Courses </h6></li>
        <p>If a student has to earn credits only just for one course to qualify for the degree after completing eight semesters of study, the college concerned may offer a contact course on a written request by the student.  The contact course is considered as fresh registration and is to be offered by the teacher concerned who shall conduct the internal evaluation procedures and allot the marks as per the regulations. Minimum contact hours for the course shall be 20.  The final examination will be conducted by the college and shall be monitored by the external academic auditor. Question paper for the examination will be given by the Controller of Examination. No grade above C shall be given for a contact course. </p>

                    For theory courses: - 1/3rd weightage for internal evaluation and 2/3rd for end semester examination.For convenience, the maximum marks for internal evaluation and end semester examination for theory courses are fixed as 50 and 100 respectively.
                </li>
                <p>Scheme of evaluation is as follows</p>

                    <li>Two internal tests each of 20 marks and of one hour duration. (Internally by the College) </li>
                    <li>Tutorials/Assignments/Mini Projects carrying 10 marks.   (Internally by the College) </li>

The re-test will cover both first and second test course plans. Those who have missed both the tests are not eligible to appear for the end semester examination. </p>
                <p>However if one misses both tests due to medical reasons or other personal exigencies, based on genuine evidence, a single test of 2 hour duration for 40 marks will be conducted covering the whole syllabus, before the end semester examinations. Decision on this will be taken by the Principal and verified by the external academic auditor. </p>
           <li><h7>For Laboratory /Practical /Workshop courses </h7></li>

    <b><h3>Addendum:- </h3></b><ol><li><h5>Calculation of SGPA/CGPA</h5></li><p>Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) are calculated as follows. SGPA = Σ(Ci×GPi)/ΣCi   where Ci is the credit assigned for a course and GPi is the grade point for that course.  Summation is done for all courses registered by the student in the semester. Here the failed courses are also accounted. CGPA = Σ(Ci×GPi)/ΣCi   where Ci is the credit assigned for a course and GPi is the grade point for that course.  Summation is done for all courses registered by the student during all the semesters for which the CGPA is needed. Here the failed courses are also accounted. CGPA of all courses passed may also be given. CGPA for the B. Tech programme is arrived at by considering all course credits that are needed for the degree and their respective grade points.</p>
